## Java practice
- The project task is to create a Haiku style program using Java.
- The requirement:
-- Complete the program header (name, date, brief description)
-- Use 6 “System.out” lines of code
-- Use two lines of code for the 4th output line shown above
-- The last output line should include a basic math formula to show the total of 17 as above
-- Insert comment(s) in your code where appropriate

# The project does not require any special installs. The user will need an IDE and JDK/SDK to run Java on the local computer.
